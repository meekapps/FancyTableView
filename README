A fancy UITableView implementation with gradient cell backgrounds and shadows underneath that add depth (like the Clock app). All done with QuartzCore, no images used.

Also, this demonstrates subclassing UITableViewCell. In this case, the default cell textLabel and detailTextLabel have white shadows. They look wonky when being selected so the subclass removes/restores said shadows when highlighted/deselected.

Enjoy!
